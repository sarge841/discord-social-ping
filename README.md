## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |

2. Create a new application or select an existing one
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Copy the bot token

### Getting Channel ID

1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Developer Mode)
2. Right-click on the channel where you want notifications
3. Select "Copy ID"

### Bot Permissions

Your bot needs the following permissions:
- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Read Message History
- Connect (to voice channels for monitoring)

## Usage

### Basic Operation

Once the bot is running and properly configured:

1. **Automatic Notifications**: The bot will automatically send a notification when someone joins a voice channel
2. **Test Command**: Send `asdf` in any channel the bot can see to test functionality
3. **Message Cleanup**: All notifications are automatically deleted after 5 minutes (300 seconds)

### Customizing Messages

You can customize the join messages by editing the `messages.txt` file:

1. Each line represents a different message template
2. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored
3. Empty lines are ignored
4. The bot will randomly select from available messages

Example message format:
```
is now hanging out in
just teleported to
decided to vibe in
```

The final message will be: `[Username] [random message] [channel name]!`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot doesn't respond**:
   - Check if the bot token is correct
   - Verify the bot has proper permissions
   - Ensure the bot is online in your Discord server

2. **No voice channel notifications**:
   - Verify the channel ID is correct
   - Check if the bot can see the notification channel
   - Ensure the bot has permission to send messages in that channel

3. **Messages file not loading**:
   - Check if `messages.txt` exists in the same directory as `main.py`
   - Verify the file is readable and properly formatted

### Debug Mode

To enable more detailed logging, you can modify the logging level in `main.py`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
